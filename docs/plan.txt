Alternative solutions:

1. Start PCJ
2. Create and train a graph with Tensorflow and safe to protobuf
3. Read graph in Java v
5. Communicate to average weights
6. ???
7. Profit



Possibilities:

- generate graph with keras, save model to java, load from java with deeplearning4j, train with java
- generate graph with tf, save it to java, load with tf java api, train with java
- generate grapg with tf, train with distributed tf
- generate graph with keras, train with horovod
- generate graph with keras, train



apples to apples =
- generate graph with tf, save model, read it with java api, start timing, distributed gradient with java, stop timing
- generate graph with tf and (start timing) train with horovod (stop timing)
